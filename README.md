## Led Blink

### Assignment Description
This Assignment was a part of the pico introduction. It was a simple assignment to get us used to the Raspberry Pi and the Python language. The assignment was to make an LED blink on and off.

### Code
```python
import time 
import board # type: ignore
import digitalio # type: ignore

led = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.LED)
led.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT


while True:
    led.value = True
    time.sleep(0.5)
    led.value = False
    time.sleep(0.5) 
```

### Reflection 
This assignment was very simple and easy to do and in my opinion was basicaly a settup test for VS code. I had no problems with this assignment and it was a good way to get used to the Raspberry Pi and the Python language. 

## Countdown

### Assignment Description
In this assignment we where tasked with making a countdown timer, counting down from 10 to 0, with a interval of 1 second.

### Code
```python
import time

for x in range(10):
    print(10-x)
    time.sleep(1)
print("Blast Off!")
```

### Reflection
This assignment was again very easy and simple. I had no problems and all i did was use a for loop to countdown. I also used the time.sleep() function to make the program wait for 1 second before printing the next number. It was a good way to refresh on the python syntax.
